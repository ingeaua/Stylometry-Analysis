### 1. Mendenhall Characteristic Curve
### 2. Kilgariff’s Chi-Squared Method

### 4. Agglomerative clustering with Ward linkage

All of the code can be found in the main.ipynb notebook.

The project is inspired by an university lab subject and [this post](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/introduction-to-stylometry-with-python) from Programming Historian.
